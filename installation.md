## Installer Jar
Jython 2.7.3 is distributed via an executable jar file installer.  After
[downloading](download) it, either double click the `jython-installer-2.7.3.jar` or run java with the -jar option
```
$ java -jar jython-installer-2.7.3.jar
```

This will start the regular GUI installer on most systems, or a console installer on headless systems.  To force the installer to work in headless mode invoke the installer as:
```
$ java -jar jython-installer-2.7.3.jar --console
```
The installer will then walk through a similar set of steps in
graphical or console mode: showing the license, selecting an install
directory and JVM and actually copying Jython to the file system.
After this completes, Jython is installed in the directory you
selected.  Executing a script in the install directory, `jython` on Unix-like systems or `jython.exe` on Windows, will start up the Jython
console, which can be used to dynamically explore Jython and the Java
runtime, or to run Jython scripts.

## Standalone Jar

The standalone option does no caching and so avoids the startup overhead (most likely at the cost of some speed in calling Java classes, but I have not profiled it)

You can try it out by running the installer:
```
$ java -jar jython-installer-2.7.3.jar
```
then when you come to the "Installation type" page, select "Standalone".

The installation will generate a `jython.jar` with the Python standard library (`/Lib`) files included, which can be run as:
```
$ java -jar jython.jar
```
Of course you can run scripts just by calling them as you might expect:
```
$ java -jar jython.jar script.py
```
Or, add this file to the classpath of your application.

## Installation options

You can get a list of installer options (to install Jython unattended, for example) by running:
```
$ java -jar jython-installer-2.7.3.jar --help
```
